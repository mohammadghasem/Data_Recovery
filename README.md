Merge sort is one of the classical sorting algorithms. Suppose we implemented this algorithm and for debugging when merging two sorted sections when comparing two elements, one from the first half of the array (elements number 0 to half the length of the array) and one from the second half of the array (elements from half to the end array), if the element of the first half of the array was smaller at the time of adding this element to the final array, the letter L is printed, and if the element of the second half of the array was smaller, the letter R is printed
